                    <p class="paragraph">Let’s get right to the point: bouncing between your inbox, pointless
                        meetings,and group chat notifications is no way to get ahead in today’s information economy.
                        These are markers of busyness not productivity. They won’t help you to deepen your writing
                        practice, master a programming language, or grow your business. In fact, these activities won’t
                        aid you in any number of the ambitious goals you’ve set for yourself. Instead, succumbing to
                        these attention traps leads you off the path of excellence and down the road of mediocrity. To
                        be truly exceptional at the work you do, and to gain recognition for it, you’ll need to adopt a
                        different strategy entirely. </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The concept was coined by Cal Newport, a renowned author and computer
                        science professor at Georgetown University, in a 2012 blog post and expanded upon in his 2016
                        bestselling book, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World. By Newport’s
                        definition, deep work refers to:

                                skill, and are hard to replicate.”</em>

                        exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">This is precisely what deep work will help you accomplish. As Newport puts it
                        “the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is
                        becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this
                        skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.” This is an actionable
                        guide based directly on Newport’s strategies in Deep Work. While we fully
                        recommend reading the book in its entirety, this guide distills all of the research and
                        recommendations into a single actionable resource that you can reference again and again as you
                        build your deep work practice. You’ll learn how to integrate deep work into your life in order
                        to execute at a higher level and discover the rewards that come with regularly losing yourself
                        in meaningful work.</p>

                    <h2 class="secondary-heading">Learn How to Practice Deep Work</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Many of us have forgotten how to focus deeply on a single task, or never really learned to in
                        the first place. In school you may have done well enough by practicing mostly shallow work on a
                        day-to-day basis, with the occasional deep work session a few times per semester to write a
                        last-minute paper or cram for a final exam.

                        Learning how to practice deep work requires you to be more intentional than you’ve ever been in
                        sitting down regularly to concentrate on high-impact tasks. These strategies will help you
                        select your preferred form of deep work, build a routine from scratch, and provide operating
                        principles and tactics for embracing the power of directed focus.

                        to implement it in your life. Newport describes four different types of deep work scheduling you
